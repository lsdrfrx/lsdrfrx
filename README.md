I've started my coding journey as backend developer. At the short time I've became a fullstack-developer on React.js and NestJS. After few years I've abandon web-development because of it's boredom, and got interested with data science and machine learning. Now I'm working in the scientific and ML-engineering fields and making cross-platform apps on Flutter as a hobby at the freetime :)

Now I'm working on a couple of interesting pet and neurobiological projects, i.e. self/project-management tool; biological spiking neural network simulator; simulation of the olfactory system. Sounds fun, because subject differs a lot ü§°

Out of duty I learn languages: English, Espa√±ol, ÌïúÍµ≠Ïù∏, play games and walk my lovely dog ‚ù§
