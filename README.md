I've started my coding journey as backend developer. At the short time I've became a fullstack-developer on React.js and NestJS. After few years I've abandon web-development because of it's boredom, and got interested with data science and machine learning. Now I'm working in the scientific and ML-engineering fields.

Out of duty I play games and learn languages: English, Espa√±ol, ÌïúÍµ≠Ïù∏.
